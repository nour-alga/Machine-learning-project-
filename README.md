# Mini Project: Machine Learning Model Selection

In this mini project, our goal is to find the best machine learning model to achieve the highest prediction accuracy on our evaluation dataset.

We start by training on our dataset. Before training, we:
- Clean the data  
- Preprocess the features  
- Visualize the data and explore the relationships between variables  

Then, we train different models and evaluate their performance. Our two best-performing models are:
- **Naive Bayes**  
- **Random Forest Classifier**  

Finally, we tune these models to achieve the best possible results.
